# FACE RECOGNITION WITH ONE-SHOT LEARNING USING A SIAMESE CNN

Face recognition with one-shot learning can be an important task such as border-control, where a certain individual needs to be found and there is little known identity or images of the person, or a employee confirming his/her attendance via a register at their place of work. This task
creates many challenges such as illumination, pose, expression and occlusion. In this paper we aim to make a Siamese Convolutional neural network (SCNN) which can recognise faces with only one image of each task One-shot learning. Although the results of the experiments were not fully finished to give us a full description of our model, there is perhaps a base from which to progress with further experiments to develop this work.

## Conclusion
The conclusion of this paper is that face recognition using a SCNN is a difficult task with many obstacles, especially with the amount of possible variations of an image such as occlusions, lighting, pose, aging and background. This paper has only scratched the surface in exploring the use of Cascade object detection to eliminate the background of each image. Al-though the results of the experiments were not fully finished there is perhaps a base from which to progress with further experiments to enhance this work.
